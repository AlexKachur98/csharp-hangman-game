ðŸŽ® Hangman Game (C# Console Application)

A console-based Hangman game developed in C# to demonstrate Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles, clean architecture, and professional coding practices.
This project features multiple difficulty levels, ASCII art visuals, and a dynamic scoreboard system, making it a fun yet robust showcase of software engineering fundamentals.

ðŸš€ Features

Menu-driven gameplay using a switch-case structure:

Play the game

View tutorial

View scoreboard

Exit

Four difficulty levels:

Easy â€“ 6 lives, simple words

Medium â€“ 6 lives, moderate words

Hard â€“ 6 lives, challenging words

Impossible â€“ 1 life, hardest words only

Dynamic word bank based on difficulty.

Real-time ASCII pixel art hangman rendering.

Scoreboard tracking: Wins and losses persist during a session.

Clean UI separation: Dedicated classes for game logic, UI, and data handling.

Fully commented code following industry documentation standards.


ðŸ›  Technologies Used

Language: C#

Framework: .NET 8.0 (or compatible version)

IDE: Visual Studio / Rider / VS Code

Paradigm: Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

ðŸŽ¯ Skills Demonstrated

This project highlights:

Clean Code Practices: Consistent naming conventions, modular structure, and detailed documentation.

OOP Design Principles: Classes, encapsulation, abstraction, and enumerations.
